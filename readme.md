# Bees Challenge â€“ Automated Bee Counting

## Project Overview

This project addresses the **Bees Challenge** provided by **CloudFactory**. The objective is to **automatically count the number of bees in images** using computer vision and machine learning.

We used **YOLOv8** for object detection, trained on the provided dataset of bee images with centroid-based annotations. The final system detects bees, displays bounding boxes, **overlays the total bee count on the image**, and saves the result.

## Methodology & Approach

### Problem Framing

Automating bee counting is valuable for ecological monitoring and agricultural studies. Accurate bee counts help researchers understand hive health, productivity, and environmental effects on pollination activity.

### Dataset Preparation

- Provided bee images were paired with dot-annotated masks marking bee positions.
- Each dot was converted to a **bounding box** using custom preprocessing logic.
- Final dataset was structured into **images/** and **labels/** compatible with YOLOv8 training format.

### Model Selection

- **YOLOv8 (n version)** chosen for its lightweight architecture ideal for prototyping and rapid experimentation.
- Object detection was selected over density estimation or segmentation for its ability to both localize and count discrete objects (bees).

### Training Details

- **Epochs:** Trained up to 150 epochs
- **Metrics monitored:** mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5-0.95, Precision, Recall.
- Utilized visualization tools to analyze training behavior and identify potential overfitting.

### Evaluation

- Predictions evaluated by overlaying bounding boxes and counts on images.
- Plotted training loss and metrics using Matplotlib for analysis.
- Achieved mAP\@0.5 of \~0.55, indicating good prototype performance with room for improvement through data expansion and model fine-tuning.

### Results Interpretation

- **mAP\@0.5 â‰ˆ 0.55** â†’ Indicates the model performs reasonably well in localizing bees in the dataset. As this is a challenging task due to occlusion, small object sizes, and annotation limitations, this is a good prototype baseline.
- **mAP\@0.5-0.95 â‰ˆ 0.20** â†’ Reflects the difficulty of tight localization, common for small-object detection tasks.
- **Precision â‰ˆ 0.54 / Recall â‰ˆ 0.61** â†’ The model tends to slightly favor detecting more bees (higher recall), at the expense of occasionally detecting false positives.
- **Conclusion** â†’ Sufficient performance for prototype and technical demonstration; further improvements achievable with more/better data and hyperparameter tuning.


### Reflections and Learnings

- **Challenges:** Working with sparse annotations (dot masks) required careful preprocessing to ensure bounding boxes represented bees accurately.
- **Alternate Approaches Considered:** Density estimation models or regression-based counting models were considered but deemed more complex for the scope of this challenge.
- **Future Improvements:** Focus on annotation quality, augmenting dataset size, and utilizing larger YOLO models for improved precision.

### Future Directions

- **Dashboard Integration:** Integrate results with dashboards for continuous ecological monitoring.
- **Automation Pipeline:** Build CI/CD pipelines for retraining models with new data.
